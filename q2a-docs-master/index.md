Welcome to the Question2Answer docs! This is a community-focused initiative to improve the documentation for Q2A. The docs contains information about installing and using Q2A, as well as developing themes/plugins and an API reference.

This site is hosted via GitHub Pages, using the Jekyll static site generator. Everyone is welcome to contribute improvements - see [the contributing page]({{ site.baseurl }}/contribute/docs/) for information about setting up Jekyll locally.
