First beta of major feature release, 26th September 2017.

### New features

- Performance has been improved by around 20% on average (even more on questions with many answers).
- Added caching system. Currently caches question data, related questions and category list for anonymous users. Caches can be stored in files or in memory (requires Memcached PHP extension).
- Added comment voting. Comments may be voted up or down, and points may be given as with answers (default is no points).
- Added ability to enable/disable plugins. For backwards compatibility, by default plugins cannot be disabled (except by removing the plugin folder entirely). Plugin developers must "opt-in" to this feature using the `load_order` property in the plugin's `metadata.json`. See the [plugin documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/plugins/#plugin-metadata).
- Added support for IPv6 addresses.
- Schema.org microdata is now used throughout Q2A.
- Number formatting characters (decimal point, thousands separator) can be specified in language files.
- Numbers (for votes, views etc) can be compacted e.g. 1.3k instead of 1300.
- Added option to block certain usernames.
- Out-of-the-box Joomla integration is now included.
- Changed the category naviation to a widget, so it can be moved to different positions.
- Widget plugins can now be placed on pages created by page plugins.
- Password security has been upgraded from `sha1` to use PHP's `password_hash` function where available.
- Password reset method has been greatly simplified.
- Questions are now checked for "double posting" when submitting.
- Added Newest users page, along with Permissions options for who can view the New or Special users pages.
- Simplified closing questions to use one field for closing with a note or as a duplicate.
- Added option to prevent users closing their own questions (i.e. limit to only admins/moderators).
- Anonymous user naming is now optional.

### Other notable changes

- Tested on PHP 7.0 and 7.1.
- Coding style has been improved and made consistent across the codebase.
- Forms on the question view page have been changed and reordered. Custom themes that override the `q_view_main`, `a_list_item`, `a_item_main`, `c_list_item`, `c_item_main` methods may need to make changes.
- 'Favorite' button on question pages moved outside `<h1>` tag. Themes may need to make changes.
- Upgraded CKEditor (4.7), jQuery (3.2), and other libraries. Custom jQuery code may need updating; see the [jQuery upgrade guide](https://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/3.0/).
- Hidden form fields can now be specified in a consistent way with regular fields (e.g. including extra attributes).
- Added date/time to user votes. This can be used by plugins to check things like voting history. Existing votes in the system are given the same date as the post during the database upgrade.
- Removed option "All new users must be approved" (`approve_user_required`) in favor of using the regular Permissions settings. Administrators relying on this option should update their Permissions settings to allow "Approved users only" where appropriate.
- Made improvements to hotness calculations, and added option to disable hotness calculation on every page view. (Slightly improves efficiency but hotness values may become out of date.)
- Separated out functions from `qa-include/qa-page.php` into `qa-include/app/page.php`. External code and Plugins can include only the latter file in order to use its functions.

## Version 1.7 beta 2 [Download](https://www.question2answer.org/releases/question2answer-1.7-beta-2.zip)

Minor improvements and fixes on the first beta, 7th December 2014.

### Changes

- Metadata for plugins, themes and languages can now be stored in a `metadata.json` file.
- Upgraded to [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) 1.11.
- Added an `initialize()` function to the theme class. Theme/plugin developers can use this for any initialization that needs to occur before content is output (previously many authors did this in the `doctype()` function). If this function is overridden, authors must call through to `parent::initialize()` so that all plugins/themes can run their initialization too.
- New DB function `qa_db_num_rows()` as a wrapper for `mysqli_result::num_rows`.
- Added a `.qa-warning` CSS class to all themes for plugins to use.
- Added option to hide post updates meta information.
- The 'selected' state of menu items is now determined in a different way: if the navigation subarray has the key `'selected_on'` then it will match the specified paths against the beginning of the requested URL. Otherwise it will look for an exact match with the array key. Example:

		$qa_content['navigation']['main']['tag']=array(
			'url' => qa_path_html('tags'),
			'label' => qa_lang_html('main/nav_tags'),
			'selected_on' => array('tags$', 'tag/'),
		);

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed various layout issues with SnowFlat theme.
- Fixed missing styles for custom sections in SnowFlat theme.
- Fixed issue with navigation items not being selected or multiple items being selected (see above change).
- Fixed front page URL not being properly mapped.

## Version 1.7 beta 1 [Download](https://www.question2answer.org/releases/question2answer-1.7-beta-1.zip)

First community-developed version of Question2Answer, 6th November 2014.

### New Features

- New responsive Snow theme.
- Private messages page, listing all PMs received and sent.
- Ability to add a required checkbox on registration form (e.g. for Terms &amp; Conditions acceptance).
- Switched to `mysqli` as the `mysql` library is deprecated.
- Include exact join date in user profiles.
- Added [closed] to closed questions where appropriate.
- Linked title on question page.
- Similar questions list (from Ask page) is now overridable in the theme (`q_ask_similar()` function). Default display is a list.
- New 'text direction' site option (only has an effect if the theme is built for it). Themes can also now access `$this->isRTL` to check if a site is using right-to-left text and act accordingly (e.g. include an alternate stylesheet).
- Users/Tags pages use a new "block layout" instead of the old nonsemantic table layout. Theme developers can activate this by setting the class member `$ranking_block_layout` to true. The Snow, Classic and Candy themes have this, but SnowFlat does not as yet.
- Language metadata can be stored in a `metadata.php` file (see `qa-lang/en-GB` for an example). Currently this only supports `display_name` as the language name, but will be improved and expanded to themes and plugins in the future.

### Other Notable Changes

- Minimum PHP 5.1.6+ requirement.
- Upgrade CKeditor plugin (v4.4).
- Various classes have been refactored for PHP 5 to include function and member visibility.
- Added some basic unit tests in the `qa-tests` folder (Github-only). See `qa-tests/README.md` for instructions.
- An 'autoloader' has been added to begin transition away from an include-oriented structure. (Currently only used for debug class.)
- The `qa-include` folder has been restructured, with related files moved to subfolders (`qa-app-*` to the `app` folder, modules to the plugins folder, etc).
- Select elements in forms can be given the `match_by` parameter to set the selected option using the array key instead of value.
- Better parsing of URLs in posts.
- Upgrade PHPMailer (v5.2.7).
- Pagination on blocked users page.

### Bug Fixes

- Added many missing button tooltips.
- Correct anchor links on comment edit/save buttons.
- Usernames with hash symbols now work on the Nginx server.
- Fixed issue that allowed a user to bypass a question's minimum length.
- Fixed issue with capitalized table prefixes in plugins.
- Fixed issue that allowed users to vote on posts before claiming them.
- Fixed issue that allowed users to favorite themselves.
- Show error when file uploads exceed the server's limits.

### Potentially Breaking Changes

- Q2A now requires PHP 5.1.6+.
- Plugin metadata must now be near the beginning of the file (within the first 8 kilobytes).
- The `init_queries` function in plugins is now passed the case-sensitive, canonical table names and not lowercased names. This means that string comparisons are now correct where site owners are using capitalized table prefixes (e.g. `QA_*`). However, it may potentially break a plugin in one situation: when a developer has manually called strtolower on the table they are checking against.
- `qa-class.phpmailer.php` and `qa-class.smtp.php` have been moved to `qa-include/vendor/PHPMailer/`. These files should not have been used directly by outside code - the built-in Q2A functions like `qa_send_email` should be used instead. If custom code is required, simply include `qa-include/vendor/PHPMailer/PHPMailerAutoload.php` and the required mail classes will be automatically loaded.

### New CSS Classes Required

- `.qa-q-title-list` (`<ul>`, basic question title list)
- `.qa-q-title-item` (`<li>`, question title list item)
- `.qa-ask-similar` (`<div>`, surrounding block for similar questions)
- `.qa-ranking-item` (`<span>`, for top users/tags pages; other related classes need replacing too)

### Deprecated Functions

- `qa-app-admin.php/qa_admin_addon_metadata`: use `qa_addon_metadata` instead.
- `qa-app-posts.php/qa_post_userid_to_handle`: use `qa_userid_to_handle` instead.

- `qa-app-limits.php/qa_limits_remaining`: use `qa_user_limits_remaining` instead.
- `qa-app-options.php/qa_options_set_pending`: no longer required.
- `qa-app-posts.php/qa_post_userid_to_handle`: use `qa_userid_to_handle` instead.
- `qa-theme-base.php/qa_html_theme_base`: PHP4-style constructor is no longer supported; please use `__construct` method instead.
- `qa-theme-base.php/post_avatar`: use `avatar` instead.
- `qa-theme-base.php/ranking_table`: table layout is no longer recommended.
- `qa-theme-base.php/ranking_table_item`: same as above.
- `qa-theme-base.php/ranking_spacer`: same as above.
